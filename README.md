# job-hunt-tracker

> When I realized that I had applied for a lot of jobs during my last stretch of unemployment, 
I made myself a simple Excel spreadsheet to keep track of everything. 
It included the following columns: job title, link to the original listing, 
the date I applied, where (or how) I found the opening, and current stage of the interview process. 
That list especially came in handy for phone interviews, but regardless of how close I was (or wasn’t) 
to getting any particular job, I don’t know how I could’ve kept track of anything during my 
job search without that spreadsheet. If you’re having trouble remembering little details, 
like how you found a particular posting, cobble together a tracker for yourself.

I think a single google sheet would be good enough, but I think it might be fun to create a job tracker to help other 
job hunter to find the job easily?

Fileds:
- job title, 
- link to the original listing, 
- the date I applied, 
- where (or how) I found the opening, 
- and current stage of the interview process. 

** I think the company profile is also helpful as well. Some other elements might be:
- Related Educational Resource

I think the purpose could be help the company to find the ideal talent easily. (There already linkedin tho ...)
